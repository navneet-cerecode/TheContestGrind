### Solving Strategies

- **Cake Making (CAKEMAKE):**  
  The problem required calculating the minimum number of operations to make all cake slices identical. Strategy involved frequency counting of slices and minimizing operations by keeping the majority slice unchanged.

- **Brick Colouring (STICKCOMP):**  
  Here the task was to determine whether the bricks can be colored in alternating fashion with given constraints. Strategy used modular checks and validation against parity of positions.

- **Fence Colouring (FENCECOL):**  
  Problem required calculating valid colorings of a fence under certain adjacency rules. Strategy used combinatorics with modular arithmetic to efficiently handle large constraints.

### Notes

- Only solved problems are included.  
- Codes are written in C++ using `#include <iostream>` and standard input/output.  
- Inline comments are added where applicable for clarity.  
- Feel free to check out the solutions and suggest improvements.
