# TheContestGrinds

Welcome to **TheContestGrinds** — a personal archive of all the coding contest problems I've solved across platforms like **Codeforces**, **CodeChef**, **LeetCode**, and **AtCoder**.

This is my grind zone. From WA to AC, from brute force to `O(log n)` sorcery — this repo is where I grow as a problem solver, one contest at a time.
