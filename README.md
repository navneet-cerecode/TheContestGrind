# ⚔TheContestGrinds

Welcome to **TheContestGrinds** — a personal archive of all the coding contest problems I've solved across platforms like **Codeforces**, **CodeChef**, **LeetCode**, and **AtCoder**.

This repo is where the grind meets the code. From WA to AC, from brute force to `O(log n)` optimizations — this is the dojo where I sharpen my DSA skills one contest at a time.
